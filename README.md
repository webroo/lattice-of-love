# Lattice of Love

My entry for the 2012 JS1k competition. An interactive heart-shaped spirograph.

The lattice pattern is based on a [hypotrochoid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotrochoid), but instead of rolling the inner cog around a circle it's rolled around a heart shape, described using the [heart-curve](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HeartCurve.html) equation.
